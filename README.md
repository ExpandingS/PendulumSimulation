# PendulumSimulation
A project showing the realtionship between time period, starting angles, and final position of a double pendulum.

MatPlotCode creates the simulation data, and stores it in  the file "data"
JustPlot only takes in the data file an displays it as both a 3d plot, and a 2d section. The time for the 2d section is defined at the top of the program, under the variable "section"
